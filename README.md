Hello there! 😊

I'm a Full Stack Engineer primarily focusing on JavaScript/Typescript + NodeJS ecosystem.

### 👨‍💻A bit of tech background 

I have been in tech professionally and as a freelance contractor for the last 10+ years initially as a .NET developer focusing on web and desktop applications. 

2015 onwards I shifted my focus to SPA frameworks such as Aurelia and React. 

The last 5+ years have exposed me to Microservices, the Cloud, Container Orchestration, DevOps plus engaged me into  recruiting, mentoring and leading an engineering team.  

### 💎What I value 

- Kindness 
- Empathy 
- Perseverance 
- **Volunteering**
 (I hold twice a week hands-on react session for university students and recent graduates and every Sunday I engage in educational activities for children, junior youth and the youth aimed at the intellectual, material and moral advancement of their neighborhood).

### 🎉 Fun facts 

- My name  translates to **meadow** in a local language
